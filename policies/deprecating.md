# How to write a deprecation notice

1.  Purpose
- what does the document cover
- Example: This deprecation document aims to ensure transparency and provide guidelines for the deprecation of features, APIs, or products to minimize disruption for users while maintaining the quality and security of our software.
2. Definitions
- Add definitions for the document
- Example: Deprecation is the process of marking a feature as obsolete and no longer recommending its use. However, the feature remains available for a specified period.
3. People/team to related
- Add who needs to be notified of this deprecation particularly those who use the feature
- Example: MS Team
4. Deprecation Process
- Notification: Describe how and when users will be informed of upcoming deprecations. Include lead times and communication channels (e.g., newsletters, changelogs, in-app notifications).
- Transition Period: Specify how long deprecated features will continue to be supported before removal.
- Grace Period for Critical Components: Outline if certain critical features will have an extended support timeline.
- Alternatives: If possible, mention alternative solutions that will be provided.
- Example: When a feature is deprecated, users will be notified at least 6 months before the feature is fully retired. During the deprecation period, users are encouraged to transition to alternative features.
5. Reason for deprecation
- Why features get deprecated: Explain the factors that could lead to deprecation (e.g., security concerns, lack of use, redundancy, etc.).
- Example: A feature may be deprecated due to security vulnerabilities, reduced usage, better alternatives, or incompatibility with new technologies.
6. Timeline
- Standard Timeline: Define the general timeframe between deprecation announcement and full removal.
- Urgent Deprecations: Outline a process for situations requiring expedited removal (e.g., security issues).
7. Support During Deprecation
- Describe the type of support users can expect during the deprecation period (e.g., continued bug fixes, documentation updates).
- Example: During the deprecation period, we will continue to provide critical bug fixes and updates to ensure stability, but no new features will be added to deprecated components.
8. Deprecation Review
- Frequency of Review: Indicate how often the policy will be reviewed and updated (e.g., annually).
- Example: This policy will be reviewed annually. Significant changes will be communicated through our regular update channels.
